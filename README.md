# ToDo WebApp

This is a simple todo list webapp react project.

Any item can be added using the input field and then clicking the add button.
To give a priority to any item, you can add the following tags : p1, p2, p3, p4 to the item while in the input field itself and it will be computed in the webapp.

Instructions will be added later. I might update this project soon.

Thank You!
